    "content": "Based on the provided medical documents, Mr. Tan Ah Kow is suffering from dementia, which is causing significant cognitive impairments and memory deficits. He is unable to retain information, understand simple concepts, perform basic arithmetic, and make decisions about his personal and financial affairs. He also has a history of medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart problems, cardiac failure, and chronic renal disease, which have likely contributed to his current cognitive state.\n\nThe medical report highlights his inability to remember basic information such as his age, address, and the day and date, despite being told recently. He is also unable to tell time from a watch, recognize notes and coins, or perform simple arithmetic. Furthermore, he is unable to recall basic information about his property and is not able to make decisions about his personal and financial affairs.\n\nThe doctor's assessment suggests that Mr. Tan Ah Kow lacks the mental capacity to make informed decisions about his personal welfare, including his medical treatment, living arrangements, and financial management. His dementia and cognitive impairments significantly impair his ability to process and understand information, making it difficult for him to make informed decisions about his life.",
