    "content": "The report highlights the challenges faced by India's healthcare system, particularly in terms of infrastructure, workforce, and access to healthcare. The key findings are:\n\n1. Lack of facilities and infrastructure: India ranks 145th among 195 countries in terms of quality and accessibility to healthcare.\n\n2. Unqualified healthcare professionals: A large number of unqualified health professionals, including quacks, traditional healers, and bonesetters, are the first point of contact for rural and poor populations, which raises safety concerns.\n\n3. Unequal distribution of healthcare staff: There is a significant disparity in the density of healthcare staff between the private and public sectors, with up to 80% of Allopathic physicians and surgeons belonging to the private sector.\n\n4. Shortage of doctors: India has a doctor-patient ratio of 1:1,445, which is far behind the WHO's recommended ratio of 1:1000.\n\n5. Private sector dominance: Private Indian hospitals cater to medical tourism, providing \"world-class service at low cost,\" and the country's medical tourism market is expected to grow to INR 570 billion by 2020.\n\n6. Digital healthcare as a solution: The report suggests that tele-consultation and digital healthcare can help improve access to healthcare, surpassing geographical boundaries and enabling patients to receive diagnoses from specialists in a short time.\n\nOverall, the report emphasizes the need to address the shortage of doctors, improve access to healthcare, and strengthen the healthcare infrastructure to ensure quality and accessible healthcare for all Indians.",
